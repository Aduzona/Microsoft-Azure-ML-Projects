# Your Project Title Here

This Project is aimed at Operationalizing Machine Learning, by applying DevOps principles to Machine Learning, usually known as MLOPs. I will start by creating an ML model from the Bank Marketing dataset, from there I deploy the model, consume endpoint it and pipeline automation. it. 


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

1.  Authentication
2.  Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume model endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline
8. Documentation



## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

**Authentication**

Starts by creating a Service Principal(SP) account which is a user role that helps to control scope of permissions. Here, SP is assigned to  access the "Bank-mkt" workspace.
